The task

It is necessary to create a site that is a catalog of films. The site should have the following pages: a list of all films (with pagination), a page for one particular movie, a page for editing movie data, a page for creating a new movie. Only those who initially posted information about this film have the right to edit the film. For each film are stored: name, description, year of release, director, user who posted the information, poster. A poster is an image file. It should be possible to upload this file to the server and view it on the movie details page. The functionality for uploading a video file of a movie is not needed, only information about it is needed. When implementing to take into account that the films in the catalog can potentially be hundreds of thousands.

The decision is attached. Used ASP.NET MVC 5. 
The database is included in the project. User accounts that have registered and uploaded movies:
login: vpr4@yahoo.com, password: PiV!x3a.7b9g.mZ
login: new1@gmail.com, password: az-SWY_LpsYvD:4
You can also register and share your movies. Using VS2017.
